CSS code style guide

The style guide is adaptation of three methodologies.

BEM - for naming conventions

SMACSS - for naming conventions and file structure

ITCSS - for file structure

1.Naming Convention

1.1 BEM

BEM => Block__Element--Modifier

1.1.1 Definitions:


Block -

A block is an independent entity, a "building block" of an application. A block can be either simple or compound (containing other blocks).

Ex: header block, search-box block, tab-group block, dropdown block etc.


Element -

An element is a part of a block that performs a certain function. Elements are context-dependent: they only make sense in the context of the block they belong to.

Ex: hdr__logo element, srch-box__tab-grp__tab element,


Modifier -

A modifier is a property of a block or an element that alters its look or behavior.

Ex: hdr--bg-ltgry, srch-bx--l, tab-grp--full-wdth, js-drpdwn--onclick etc.

1.1.2 Seperators inside class names:

Blocks and Elements are seperated by Double Underscore.

Elements and Modifiers are seperated by Double Hyphens.

Use Hyphens to separate words in long names.

1.1.3 Order of rules (in the order of component specificity):

Default block && Default Element rules. ( Ex: .hdr__logo )

Default block && Modified Element rules. ( Ex: .hdr__logo--l )

Modified block && Modified Element rules. ( Ex: .hdr--deals__logo--l )

1.2 Identifier & Values Ruleset

1.2.1 Basic Rules

ID's should not be used.

Javascript classes (mentioned in JS code) should have the prefix "js-" to a regular css class. (Ex: hdr__srch-box => js-hdr__srch-bx)

Size Keywords -

l, s => large, small

xl, xxl => extra large, ...

xs, xxs => extra small, ...

outer div of a block is blck__wrppr and inner one is blck__innr

'0'(zero value) should not have units like 'px'.

box-shadow color values should be opacity variations of black but not grey colors. (Ex: rgba(0,0,0,0.5) instead of #888).

1.2.2 Word Shortening:

These rules are about how words in classes are to be shortened and without loosing readability.

Remove vowels except first letter.

Remove repeating consonents

If two shortnames are same (Ex: clutter and clatter => cltr) first unique vowel will be kept.

All abbreviated words will be Uppercase (Ex: btn--GTS for Go-To-Store button)

Dont remove vowels for words having <= 4 letters

Mention original word as a comment if its needed for readability.

1.2.3 Word Types:

Objects => Nouns

Modifiers => Adjective

Actions (Trumps) => Verb (Ex: pull-left, hghlght-text, clrfx, algn-cntr, hide)

2. Structure

2.1 ITCSS

ITCSS => Inverted Triangle CSS.

Code within a CSS file should start and end -

Far-reaching to Localised

Low specificity to High specificity

2.1.1 Layers

Settings - Global variables, config switches. [_settings.less]

Tools - Default mixins and functions. [_functions.less]

Generic - Ground-zero styles (resets, box-sizing). [_reset.less]

Base - Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors). [_basic.less]

Objects - Cosmetic-free design patterns. [_objects.less]

Components - Designed components, chunks of UI. [_component.less]

Trumps - Helpers and overrides. [_helper.less]
